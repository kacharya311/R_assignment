## First things first! Great job!

* You have done a great job with the assignment. I have a very few comments about the code and the whole assignment.

## Missing some files

In the instructions it is mentioned that we should include three different files;
    * a README.md file describing its general organization
    * a separate file in the "R Markdown" format that contains both the code and the description of the workflow, and
    * an output file in either HTML or PDF format
I see you have a README file. You just need to update it adding the organization of the repository. You also don't have the html or pdf file. In the top bar, you can see a blue icon saying Knit. So if you click that, you can get the html file. If you need a different format, you can select the output format from the drop down menu of Knit.

## Coding

### Looks great

You have done a great job with the script. It looks nice and ran smoothly without any errors. Your graphs also look great and especially I like your own visualization.

### Using lapply()/sapply()

I see you have used loops for generating your files. Instead of loops, I think we can use lapply()/sapply() functions. I also have used loops, but I'm gonna try those functions as well. May be you also can try that.

## That's all

I think all parts of the code look fine. You have done a nice job. Wish you good luck with the assignment.
